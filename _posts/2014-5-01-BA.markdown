Branding for the Kingston degree show.

You leave art school with much more than just a Bachelor of Arts. What else could BA(Hons) stand for?

The website we made allowed visitors to scroll through B words and A words, making their own combinations. See how it worked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIqy1UJ_G6w). We also launched a [Bizarre Archive](https://www.instagram.com/bachelorarts/) of found combinations around the school.

We were allowed to keep the word 'bitchin' but asked to remove 'armpits'
