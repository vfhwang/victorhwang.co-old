I’m curious about how long these take me to write - I’ll let you know at the bottom. I’m chewing through some apple and peanut butter this week.

We released our first guide, (How to make a will)[https://farewill.com/guides/how-to-make-a-will] , this week. Everytime I look at the illustrations Louis has put together for each article it makes me smile. Especially the one for (What happens to pets when their owners die?)[https://farewill.com/articles/what-happens-to-pets-when-their-owners-die]. 

Other than all the bits and pieces to get that live, I’ve been working on a better way to let users edit the details of people in their will. Everytime someone calls up asking how to do it I wince. I’m sure lots of people are just giving up. A while back I sketched out a hacky solution, which the team suggested we test before implementing. When making a prototype out of that solution this week I realised how terrible it was in practice. I’d fallen into the trap of trying to plaster over a bad solution - and probably should have picked up on people’s retisense to implement as a bad sign. The new solution is much clearer (we think).

I spent Friday morning covering the phone lines, which was equal parts nerve wracking and fascinating. I’ve covered the live chat a few times before, but hearing someone on the other end of the line is totally different. I caught myself chatting a lot of nonsense in the beginning to stall for time. Not sure what the people at the other end made of that. I might suggest that we do it as a product team once a month.

I loved seeing (Cerith Wyn Evans’ work at the White Cube)[https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/cerith_wyn_evans_bermondsey_2020] on Saturday. It’s the kind of exhibition that would have blown my mind when I was 14, visiting galleries for the first time. And then I spent an afternoon digging into (Longing For Less)[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/books/review-longing-for-less-minimalism-kyle-chayka.html] whilst sitting around at the Tate Modern. I realised at the end of Part 1 that I could wander down a few floors to see the work by Agnes Martin that I’d just read about. I decided it was a nice moment.

22 minutes to write that. I still have to go back and add pictures. All the apple and peanut butter is gone
