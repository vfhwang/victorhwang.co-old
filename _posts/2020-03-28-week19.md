I felt like writing these again today. Hello!

It’s been a little while. I've felt like I've never had more and less time.

I’ll keep it short.

This morning some flowers arrived from pals at work. Because it’s my birthday tomorrow. Really lovely, thanks fellas.

I’ve had time to bake again. This is a baby loaf from this morning cooling outside. In the background is a shelf I’m painting yellow to go in my bathroom.

This is my makeshift standing desk. It’s been helping me feel less cramped. Yes, my room is messy.

Between all this work’s been busy. We’ve had a massive surge in demand, which has seen the whole team pull together to make sure we’re still offering the best service possible to people. 

We’re also getting ready to put a few design job ads out and putting together plans for the next few months. 

That’s it for now!
