<div class="intro">
	<p>I'm a designer, currently making services and products with Farewill. </p>
	<p>I help people, organisations and things solve problems. </p>
	<p>I believe in thinking through making.</p>


</div>
Before Farewill I worked at UK Parliament, and before that the BBC. I've also done stints at <a target="_blank" href="https://mettle-studio.com/">Mettle</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://commonindustry.co.uk/">Common Industry</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://sugru.com/">Sugru</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://moderndesignreview.com/">Modern Design Review</a>.
